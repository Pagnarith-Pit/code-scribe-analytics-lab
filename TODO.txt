1) Students first come into module: timer starts. If they click off, timer stops. When they click back in, timer resumes.
2) When student comes back to the module, the hint level is the same as previous one
2) When a student hasn't reset the module, it should just load the entire completed module
3) Hint timer is counted for each sub problem and each levels
4) The hint timer is saved into database

Current Bugs:
1) When I click out of problem / close tab, we get this error. Issue is the end time is null.
- POST /api/track/end-subproblem HTTP/1.1" 415

2) The hint usage loading upon re-entry is still error

3) The hint usage timing, upon exit page, is also null. Must be handled with api/track/end-problem

4) hintusagelogs is logging multiple times. I only want it once.
